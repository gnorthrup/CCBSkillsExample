This is an example of a third page for your website. Maybe it is about science? You have to make this one yourself so remember to include the front matter, including a title and a permalink!

You can also include images on your website. I put them all in a directory /images, then call them from the necessary page using the markdown syntax ```![Caption](path to file.jpg)```
