![Hello](/images/hello2.jpeg)
I made a website! This text shows up on the landing page for your site. The theme takes care of the header and footer, but you can also add links in your text to things like [maybe a CV](/files/ExampleCV.pdf). You can also link to the other pages on your site!

Links can be made using the markdown syntax ```[Caption](path of link)``` but jekyll also knows how to deal with HTML syntax in these files as well.
