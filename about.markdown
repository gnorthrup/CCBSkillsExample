This is the base Jekyll theme, minima. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)

You can find the source code for Minima at GitHub:

There are lots of different types of themes. The easiest ones to use involve adding a gem to the gemfile, then simply updating the config file to call the new theme.

You can also find themes that have not been turned into gems, and simply fork their repository (giving credit of course)!
